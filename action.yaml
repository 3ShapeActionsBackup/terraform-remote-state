outputs:
  json_output_path:
    description: |
      This is the path to all the root module outputs in a JSON file.
      The path is relative to the Actions workspace.

      For example, with the Terraform config:

      ```hcl
      output "service_hostname" {
        value = "example.com"
      }
      ```

      The file pointed to by this output will contain:

      ```json
      {
        "service_hostname": "example.com"
      }
      ```

      Terraform list, set and tuple types are cast to a JSON array, map and object types are cast to a JSON object.
